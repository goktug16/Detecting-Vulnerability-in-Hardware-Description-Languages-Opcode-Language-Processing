# Detecting-Vulnerability-in-Hardware-Description-Languages-Opcode-Language-Processing

**Overview:** 

Our project utilizes a CNN-based neural network architecture to identify trojan patterns within hardware designs. We conduct a comparative analysis by examining both the opcode version of the HDL code and the HDL code itself to obtain our results.
